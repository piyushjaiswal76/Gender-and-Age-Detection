# Gender-and-Age-Detection
Gender and age detection using deep learning involves training neural networks to classify and predict a personâ€™s gender and age from visual data, typically images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for this task due to their ability to automatically extract features from images.
